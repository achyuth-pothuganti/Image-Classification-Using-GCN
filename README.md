# **Image Classification Using Graph Convolutional Networks**

## **Overview**
This project explores graph-based image classification using **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**. Images are transformed into graph representations using **Delaunay Triangulation** and **SLIC-based superpixel segmentation**, allowing GCNs to capture relational and spatial dependencies. The project uses the **Intel Image Classification dataset** to evaluate these methods, comparing their accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used is the [Intel Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification), which contains 24,000 natural scene images (150x150 pixels) across six classes:
- **Buildings**
- **Forest**
- **Glacier**
- **Mountain**
- **Sea**
- **Street**

### **Data Split**:
- Training: 14,000 images
- Testing: 3,000 images
- Prediction: 7,000 images

## **Graph Construction Techniques**
### 1. **Delaunay Triangulation**:
   - **Nodes**: Pixels of the image.
   - **Edges**: Formed by Delaunay triangulation, connecting spatially proximate pixels.
   - **Features**: RGB values of pixels.

### 2. **SLIC Superpixel Segmentation**:
   - **Nodes**: Superpixels generated by SLIC algorithm.
   - **Edges**: Region adjacency graph (RAG) connecting neighboring superpixels.
   - **Features**: Regional attributes such as mean color, eccentricity, solidity, aspect ratio, and perimeter.

## **Model Architecture**
The **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** used in this project consists of:
- **Graph Convolution Layers**: With BatchNorm and ReLU activation.
- **Pooling Layer**: Global mean pooling for graph-level feature aggregation.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For final classification.
- **Dropout**: For regularization.

### **Training Configuration**:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: CrossEntropy
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Batch Size: 32
- Epochs: 
  - 50 for Delaunay
  - 100 for SLIC

## **Results**
| **Metric**              | **Delaunay Triangulation** | **SLIC Segmentation** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Test Accuracy**        | 63.57%                   | 73.0%                 |
| **Training Speed**       | Slower                   | Faster                |
| **Preprocessing Speed**  | Faster                   | Slower                |

### **Key Insights**:
- SLIC segmentation achieves higher accuracy by effectively capturing regional features, though it requires additional preprocessing time.
- Delaunay is faster in preprocessing but computationally intensive during training due to pixel-level representation.

## **Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/achyuth-pothuganti/Image-Classification-Using-GCN.git
   cd Image-Classification-Using-GCN
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
---
### **Usage**
Prepare the Dataset:
- Download the dataset from Kaggle.
- Place it in the data/ folder.
  
Run the Notebooks:
- Delaunay Triangulation:
  ```
  jupyter notebook notebooks/Delaunay_GCN.ipynb

### **Limitations**
- **Delaunay Triangulation**: Computationally expensive and achieves lower accuracy (63.57%) due to its pixel-level representation.
- **SLIC Segmentation**: Higher accuracy (73.0%) but requires more preprocessing and still lags behind traditional CNNs (~85-90%).
---
### **Future Work**
- **Hybrid Graph Construction**: Combining pixel-level and regional features for enhanced accuracy.
- **Hierarchical GCNs**: Incorporating multi-scale graph structures.
- **Optimized Preprocessing**: Reducing time complexity for large-scale datasets.
